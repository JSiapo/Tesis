abstract = {The diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy (DR) through colour fundus images requires experienced clinicians to identify the presence and significance of many small features which, along with a complex grading system, makes this a difficult and time consuming task. In this paper, we propose a CNN approach to diagnosing DR from digital fundus images and accurately classifying its severity. We develop a network with CNN architecture and data augmentation which can identify the intricate features involved in the classification task such as micro-aneurysms, exudate and haemorrhages on the retina and consequently provide a diagnosis automatically and without user input. We train this network using a high-end graphics processor unit (GPU) on the publicly available Kaggle dataset and demonstrate impressive results, particularly for a high-level classification task. On the data set of 80,000 images used our proposed CNN achieves a sensitivity of 95{\%} and an accuracy of 75{\%} on 5,000 validation images.},

@article{Bondi2016,
abstract = {Face recognition systems based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or convolutional architectures currently represent the state of the art, achieving an accuracy comparable to that of humans. Nonetheless, there are two issues that might hinder their adoption on distributed battery-operated devices (e.g., visual sensor nodes, smartphones, and wearable devices). First, convolutional architectures are usually computationally demanding, especially when the depth of the network is increased to maximize accuracy. Second, transmitting the output features produced by a CNN might require a bitrate higher than the one needed for coding the input image. Therefore, in this paper we address the problem of optimizing the energy-rate-accuracy characteristics of a convolutional architecture for face recognition. We carefully profile a CNN implementation on a Raspberry Pi device and optimize the structure of the neural network, achieving a 17-fold speedup without significantly affecting recognition accuracy. Moreover, we propose a coding architecture custom-tailored to features extracted by such model.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in computer vision have provided opportunities for new applications in agriculture. Accurate yield estimation of fruit and vegetable crops is very important for better harvesting and marketing planning and logistics. This paper proposes a method for detecting the maturity levels (green, orange, and red) of fresh market tomatoes (Roma and Pear varieties) by combining the feature color value with the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) classification technique. A maturity detection device based on computer vision technology was designed specifically to acquire the tomato images in the lab. The tomato images were processed and the targets of the tomatoes were obtained based on the image processing technology. After that, the maximum inscribed circle of the tomato's surface was identified as the color feature extraction area. The color feature extraction area was divided into five concentric circles (sub-domains). The average hue values of each sub-region were extracted as the feature color values and used to describe the maturity level of the samples. After that, the five feature color values were imported to the BPNN as input values to detect the maturity of the tomato samples. Analysis of the results shows that the average accuracy for detecting the three maturity levels of tomato samples using this method is 99.31{\%}; and the standard deviation is 1.2{\%}.},

We propose a deep learning architecture, which is called as Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix Convolutional Neural Networks (GLCM-CNN), to semi-unsupervisedly identify a cattles race given thousands of its images with complex background settings. We introduce and evaluate GLCM features, i.e., contrast, energy, and homogeneity into CNN learning for GLCMs capability to recognize pattern with diverse variations, robustness to geometric distortion, and simple transformation. Our experiments show that GLCM-CNN is gives higher classification accuracy and requires less number of learning iterations than the original CNN. In our approach, the data input layer has better distinguishing features than the original image. In addition, our method does not require any prior segmentation process. In this paper, we also address the reduction of computation overhead using saliency maps.},
